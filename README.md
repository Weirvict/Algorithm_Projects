# Advanced Algorithm Projects Overview

This repository serves as a portfolio of two major sets of algorithm-focused coursework completed in C++ and Python. The **C++ collection** explores foundational topics such as sorting algorithms, binary trees, counting sort, quicksort variations, and B+ tree structures. These assignments emphasized performance analysis, Big-O reasoning, and direct memory management—providing low-level insights into algorithm implementation. In contrast, the **Python projects** shift toward higher-level algorithm design and theoretical applications, covering areas such as primality testing, convex hull computation, dynamic programming for gene sequencing, graph-based routing with Dijkstra’s algorithm, and solutions to NP-complete problems like the Traveling Salesperson. Together, these two tracks highlight a breadth of algorithmic understanding, from systems-level thinking in C++ to complex problem-solving and data structure design in Python. Each individual repository contains detailed breakdowns, code implementations, and testing outcomes specific to that language and assignment set.
