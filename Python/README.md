Spring 2024 Advanced Algorithms Projects

## Project 1: Primality Test
The purpose of this project is to get used to Python. It will also have algorithms for modular arithmetic. In this project, there are implementations of a prime number test based on Fermat's little theorem and the Miller-Rabin conditions. More information can be found in the project files.

## Project 2: Convex Hull
In this project, I implemented a divide and conquer algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points and analyzed the algorithm both theoretically and empirically. That can be found in the respected files.

## Project 3: Network Routing
In this project, the Dyskstraâ€™s algorithm is implemented to find paths through a graph representing a network routing problem. There are two different data structures to implement a priority queue in order to see that both algorithm design *and* data structure implementation significantly affect performance.

## Project 4: Gene Sequencing
In this project, I implemented two versions of a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the minimal cost of aligning gene sequences and extracting (an) optimal alignment. In the process, we learned a little bit about computational genomics and how domain knowledge can affect algorithm design.

## Project 5: Traveling Salesperson
In this project, I implemented a branch and bound algorithm to find solutions to the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) and get the first taste of dealing with NP-completeness.
